## PID & PPID

A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid):

Note in the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.

Each process has a parent: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the getppid system call (man 2 getppid), from within the child process.
